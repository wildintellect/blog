title: Free and Open Source Tools for GPS Data Management and Analysis
---

Here's a copy of the poster I did for
<a href="http://aag.org" class="ext-link">Â AAG 2011</a> meeting. It's
part of my master's thesis on Geoinformatic techniques for dealing with
GPS telemetry data using an Open Source stack.

Specifically:

-   Python
-   Spatialite (SQLite)
-   QGIS
-   R

See the attached pdf which was created in latex using Beamer and the
Beamerposter packages.
