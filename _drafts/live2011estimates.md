title: OSGeo Live Partial Download Estimates
---

I had a chance this last week to do a little bit of analysis on the
download logs for the
<a href="http://live.osgeo.org" class="ext-link">Â OSGeo-Live</a>
project. The basics: downloads have increased quite a bit from version
4.5 to 5.0 and the full 4.4 GB iso file is the most popular but that
doesn't mean there aren't quite a few people downloading the other
variants.

There is some uncertainty in the actual numbers as I haven't had a
chance to filter out bots, incomplete downloads, etc... Also for those
wondering I do plan to follow up with a Map of downloads by
country/region soon but early estimate is people from 100 different
countries have downloaded.

These graphs represent data for all of 2011 from 2 of 5 servers, the 2
in California.

Anyone know what the difference is between viewed, entry and exit on
awstats?
