Some of you may have arrived here looking for my photos. That site is
temporarily down while I shift some things around, upgrade some servers,
and come up with a better long term plan of what I want to do.

As it was, I hadn't added any new photos for several years and that
seemed quite silly. Primarily because it was a technical issue; who knew
moving 100 of photos onto a decent web server where visitors can browse
efficiently would be so confusing.

Anyways, be patient, let me know if you have questions. tech at
