title: Finding the Right Seat
---

As many people ended up on semi-permanent or very long term work from home, a lot more people now are putting more thought into how they spend their day; sitting. Yes for some a standing desk may be a full/partial solution, but for other times it's sitting, and that chair you have is probably not good for the number of hours you're spending sitting.

> Notes: Obligatory reminders, it's recommended to get up every so often (~ every hour or so I've seen) and take a short stretch or walk about, even if it's just to another room and back. Which is great since looking away from your screen for a few seconds is also recommended. Me I go peak out the window to see what birds or weather is going on.

## The Fit

What makes an ergonomic chair - the ability to adjust it to fit your body size and needs.
This can be surprisingly hard, a lot of chairs are for [above average](https://www.vox.com/2014/6/30/5857354/what-are-the-tallest-countries-in-the-world) [American men](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm). The information about features and fit applies to everyone but the recommendations here are not for tall and/or large people, or very those on the shorter side. This house has 5' 8" and 5' 6" sitters. 

> Important step, get out the tape measure, and use this [guide](https://www.healthyworkstations.com/resources/ergo/TakingMeasurements.pdf) to figure out your size.

### Ranking of adjustments

1. Height - feet flat on the floor
2. Seat Depth - 2 inches behind your knee to the front of the chair
3. Back Tilt - some sources say a slight recline is better
4. Arms
  1. Height
  2. Width
  3. Forward/Back (Optional)
  4. Rotation (Optional)

Nice to haves:
* Headrests - depends on your height/build (tends to be favored by taller people)
* Lumbar support - depends on your height/build
* Material - Cloth and/or Mesh back
* Warranty - though they usually don't cover wear & tear or inappropriate uses (hall racing), just manufacturing glitches.

Here's a [guide to how to properly adjust your chair]() since you've likely been doing it wrong.

## The Back Story

Literally after working from home for a year, some mild physical activity, back pain set in and wouldn't go away. Person 1 and Person 2 swapped chairs for a few days, oh ya that old 2nd hand 10+ yr chair was not helping. While it had lots of adjustments and was a good size, the super plush seat was actually not balanced or good for all day sitting, this was a few hours a day kind of chair, not an all day thing. Even the decent $200, best of what Office Whatever had in stock 3 years ago is also starting to age. And so it was time to over research new chairs, enjoy.

## The Shopping

1st thing, you're looking for a Task Chair or an Ergonomic Chair. Student chairs, executive chairs, and to some extent gaming chairs* are not intended nor designed for 6-10 hours a day. You don't want a super cushy or super hard seat either. Cloth is cooler, and a back that breathes (mesh) is likely to be more comfortable. Realize you're going to spend almost as much time in this thing as you do in bed, and likely more than on the couch - be willing to spend some $$ to not end up with muscle and joint pain later.

Many sites have rankings, a few top brands and models come out looking across them:

### Bargain, Under $200
* Flash Furniture Mid-Back Mesh
* Alera Elusion Series Mesh Mid-Back Multi-function Chair

### Break the Bank, $500+
* Herman Miller Sayl, or Aeron Chair: note there are 3 Aeron sizes- A,B,C , get the right one for your body size
* Steelcase Leap, Think, Amia, or Gesture
* Humanscale ...

### Sweet Spot, $200-$500
* Branch Task Chair
* Steelcase Series 1
* Fully Desk Chair
* Hon Ignition
* Ikea JÄRVFJÄLLET

> * Why not gaming chairs, while ArsTechnica has some in depth reviews of some gaming chairs that really approach office usability, they don't seem to be designed for extended typing use, and generally for larger bodies.

Here are many of the lists/reviews I read:

## The Choice

So following all those lists of great chairs, the Branch Task Chair caught my eye. When checking out the company I realized they had an even better chair for only $50 more. The winner
at $300 with shipping was the [Branch Ergonomic Chair](https://www.branchfurniture.com/products/ergonomic-chair?sscid=41k5_curu7&). It hit all the check boxes and some bonuses.

> Buy a chair or other furniture with [this link](https://fbuy.io/branchfurniture/alex7564 ) to get $20 off, I'll be upfront that they will credit it me for the referral - all $$ I get from this will go to support some open source/humanitarian cause.

Branch is an interesting company, they switched to direct to consumer during the Pandemic to make up for loss in corporate office contracts, they only have a few models/colors which actually makes it way easier to shop, customer support has been great, when they realized the color I picked was going to be delayed in global shipping, they reached out and let me change to something that would ship right away. Bonuses for using some recycled material, and picking material that will last, the no nonsense site helped too.

It didn't work out for Person 2, so I adopted the chair, and after fiddling with the lumbar support for a week to find the right spot it's been great. The wheel base is actually metal, and quite sturdy. While not everyone's asthetic, the Star Trek look works for me.

The Steelcase Series 1 was the runner up at $370-$415 (depends on sales and options). I actually had a Steelcase Think at my last office job. It was a decent chair, but not any better for the price difference, and the Amia actually get's better reviews at a lower price.

## The Choice 2
As noted above the Branch didn't work out for both sitters. So we did end up getting a Steelcase Series 1, which Person 2 is happier with, and I also think it's a great chair. The one knock is it's still too tall. Without shoes on, it might not go low enough for a 5' 6" person. So for shorter people, I'd suggest considering getting the stool verion, which has a foot rest, looking for other external foot rests or continuing the search for a non-student chair that is sized appropriately.
