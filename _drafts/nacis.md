title: NACIS 2009 Opening up
---

So at the AAG Conference last year, we ran an
<a href="http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/AAG_2009" class="ext-link"> OSGeo
booth</a>. Some representative from North American Cartographic
Information Society
(<a href="http://nacis.org" class="ext-link"> NACIS</a>) approached and
invited us to their conference.(It wasn't the 1st time after one of my
talks on FOSS previously I had been asked).

Now the important part, the California Chapter gave a 50 minute, 4 app
demo at the NACIS "Practical Cartography Day" to an audience of 150.

Take home message - Cartographers want good svg output.

Notes from the rest of the conference, "Open" was actually mentioned a
lot. Here's a rough breakdown of the frequency of relevant topics(In
presentations):

-   Postgis ++
-   OpenLayers(not by name but showed up in slides and on demo sites)
    +++
-   mapnik ++
-   GDAL +
-   Modestmaps
-   php +++
-   OpenSource +++++(Even ESRI)
-   Python +++
-   OpenStreetmap ++++
-   Flash/Flex +++++++
-   OGC +
-   Inkscape +
-   GIMP +
-   WMS +

(Maybe I'll post a plot when I get chance)

Next post: Some new public domain datasets people are going to want to
get their hands on...
