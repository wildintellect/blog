Well, I've got it installed. Not 100% configured yet but we'll see if
this manages to work as a decent blog platform.

For those curious I'm using the
<a href="http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/FullBlogPlugin" class="ext-link"> FullBlogPlugin</a>
with a <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org" class="ext-link"> Trac</a>
site. Not exactly meant for a blog, but it will let me post code
snippets and downloadable applications I write, including python eggs.
