Congratulations to Gary Sherman who's recent book has successfully made
it to the shelves of academia. Well that might be in part to our
librarian taking advice on what open source gis books are missing that
should be on the shelf. Lucky for everyone else, since the publisher
didn't classify it as a text book it's also affordable too if you want
your own copy, paper or ebook.
