title: Free and Open Source Tools for GPS Data Management and Analysis
---

Here's a copy of the poster I did for
<a href="http://aag.org" class="ext-link">Â AAG 2011</a> meeting. It's
part of my master's thesis on Geoinformatic techniques for dealing with
GPS telemetry data using an Open Source stack.

Specifically:

-   [Python](https://python.org)
-   [Spatialite (SQLite)](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index)
-   [QGIS](https://qgis.org)
-   [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)

See the attached [pdf]({{site_baseurl}}/assets/AAG2011-AlexMandel-Poster.pdf) which was created in latex using Beamer and the
Beamerposter packages.
